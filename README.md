Project Two General Assembly Boston SEI03

Title of Project: "Hangout Boston"

Technologies Used Include: -HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Jquery, AJAX, Handlebars

Planning:

-My original planning started with creating my wireframe and ERD based off of what I wanted my SPA to look like. However, as many new developers learn, things do not always go to plan. When I first began the Hangout Boston Project, I built my back end database first. I was able to migrate everything the way I wanted and created a database that belonged to the User. After I tackled the API, I moved on to my front end and created the user authentication and other browser functionality for the User. Overall, I have learned a lot from collaboration with other peers in my course and from my instructors.

Unsolved Issues:

-I would love to be able to have the User be able to see all the restaurants that every user has made, and then like and/or save restaurants/bars to use in the future when making plans to "hang-out" in Boston. In addition, the CSS on my page needs more love and attention. In the future, I hope to be able to spend more time on making my page look more User friendly.

Please find User Stories Below:
1. As a user, I want to be able to sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and change my password.
2. As a user, I want to be able to see recommended places to go in Boston based off my preferences.
3. As a user, I want to be able to log in and see a list of my saved restaurants I would like to go to in the future.
